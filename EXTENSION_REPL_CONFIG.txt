CONFIGURATION FOR EXTENSION REPL
================================

Since you have a PRE-BUILT static extension, you need to configure
the Extension Repl to serve files directly without a build step.

IN YOUR EXTENSION REPL (Cartography Extension):

1. Check if there's a `.replit` file at the root
   - If YES: Edit it
   - If NO: Create it

2. Replace/Create `.replit` with this content:

```toml
run = ""
[deployment]
build = [" "]
publicDir = "public"
```

3. If there's a `package.json` file, you can delete it (we don't need it)

4. If there's a `src/` folder, delete it (we're using the pre-built `public/` files)

5. Your final file structure should be:

```
Cartography Extension/
├── .replit
├── extension.json
└── public/
    ├── extension.html
    ├── icon.svg
    └── assets/
        ├── main-BU2VD84Z.js
        └── main-Bgj7Vesx.css
```

IMPORTANT: The `extension.json` needs to be at the ROOT level (not in public/)
and also accessible at the public URL `/extension.json`.

Actually, based on the docs, we might need TWO copies:
- One at root: `extension.json`
- One in public: `public/extension.json`

Try this first, then open Extension Devtools again.
