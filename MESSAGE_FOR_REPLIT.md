# Message for Replit Agent

Hi Replit Agent! 👋

I need your help testing the LogiGo AI integration features in the browser. Antigravity has completed all backend testing (16/16 tests passed ✅), and now we need to verify the UI works correctly.

## Your Task

**Test the browser/UI integration** of LogiGo's new AI features.

**Time Required:** 90 minutes  
**Number of Tests:** 5  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Getting Started

1. **Read the handoff document:**
   - Open: `REPLIT_AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
   - This gives you the overview and context

2. **Follow the detailed instructions:**
   - Open: `REPLIT_BROWSER_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - This has step-by-step instructions for all 5 tests

3. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run the tests:**
   - Test 1: File Watch UI Updates (20 min) - CRITICAL
   - Test 2: Theme Toggle (10 min) - CRITICAL
   - Test 3: License Authentication (15 min) - HIGH
   - Test 4: Bidirectional Sync (20 min) - CRITICAL
   - Test 5: Council Service UI (25 min) - HIGH

## What I Need Back

1. **Test Results Summary** (pass/fail for each test)
2. **Screenshots** (18 total - specified in instructions)
3. **Issues Found** (if any, with severity)
4. **Launch Recommendation** (GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL)

Create a file called `REPLIT_BROWSER_TEST_RESULTS.md` with your findings.

## Key Points

- ✅ All backend code is verified and working
- ✅ API endpoints are functional
- ✅ Your focus is purely on UI/browser behavior
- ⭐ Critical tests (1, 2, 4) must pass for launch
- 📸 Take screenshots as you go (don't wait until the end)

## Questions?

- Check `REPLIT_BROWSER_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- All backend details are in `ANTIGRAVITY_TEST_RESULTS.md`

Thanks for your help! This is the final validation before we launch the AI integration features. 🚀
