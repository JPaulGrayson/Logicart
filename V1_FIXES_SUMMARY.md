## 🎯 What Was NOT Fixed (Deferred to V1.1)

These items were identified but deferred as they're not blockers for V1 launch:

### 1. Code Refactoring
**Issue:** Large files (Workbench.tsx: 3,130 lines, routes.ts: 2,084 lines)  
**Reason for Deferral:** Functional code, refactoring is a quality improvement not a blocker  
**Planned for:** V1.1

### 2. TypeScript Strict Mode
**Issue:** Some implicit 'any' types remain in application code  
**Reason for Deferral:** Fixed in packages, application code works correctly  
**Planned for:** V1.1

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Issue:** No rate limiting on API endpoints  
**Reason for Deferral:** Security enhancement, not critical for initial launch  
**Planned for:** V1.1

### 4. Bundle Size Analysis
**Issue:** No bundle size optimization  
**Reason for Deferral:** Performance optimization, not a blocker  
**Planned for:** V1.1
