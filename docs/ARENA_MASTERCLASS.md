# Arena Masterclass: The Council of 4
**Mastering multi-model generation and competitive debugging in LogicArt Studio.**

---

## 🏛 The "Council" Concept
The LogicArt Arena is not just a chat box—it's a **Logic Benchmark**. By prompting four distinct AI architectures (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5, and Grok 4) simultaneously, you can see the "Structural Consensus" of an algorithm.

## ⚡ Model Arena (Creation Mode)
Use this mode to generate code from scratch and compare how different models think about control flow.

### 1. The Power Prompt
The best Arena results come from **Structural Constraints**. 
*   **Bad**: *"Write a sorting algorithm."*
*   **Masterclass**: *"Create a merge sort that uses an in-place buffer. Prioritize shallow recursion and include @logicart labels for each partition step."*

### 2. Comparative Visualization
Once the "Council" responds, don't just read the code—**scroll the flowcharts**.
*   **Gemini** often produces flatter, more imperative logic.
*   **Claude** tends toward elegant, functional recursion.
*   **GPT-4o** usually balances safety and standard patterns.
*   **Visual Diff**: Look for which model created the fewest "Cognitive Jumps" (simplified edges).

### 3. The Chairman's Verdict
At the bottom of the Arena, the **LLM Chairman** analyzes all four responses. It looks for:
*   **Syntactic Completeness**: Did any model omit a semicolon or edge case?
*   **Structural Efficiency**: Which flowchart has the lowest complexity score?
*   **Consensus**: Where did 3 out of 4 models agree on an implementation?

## 🐞 Debug Arena (Triage Mode)
The Debug Arena is designed to solve "Impossible Bugs" by getting four independent diagnostic perspectives.

### 1. Providing Context
For the best debugging advice, provide the "Holy Trinity" of context:
1.  **The Error**: Paste the raw stack trace.
2.  **The Logic**: The function that failed.
3.  **The Environment**: Mention if it's running in Node, a Browser, or LogicArt.

### 2. Multi-Perspective Triage
*   **Model A** might identify a memory leak.
*   **Model B** might spot a race condition in an `async` call.
*   **The Chairman** will synthesize these into a "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3" recovery plan.

## 🔑 BYOK (Security & Autonomy)
LogicArt is a "Client-Side First" platform. 
*   **Persistence**: Your API keys are stored in your **Local Browser Storage**, never on our database.
*   **Headers**: Keys are sent directly from your client to the provider via secure headers.
*   **Flexibility**: You can toggle specific models ON or OFF depending on your available credits.

## 💡 Expert Tips
*   **The 50/50 Rule**: Use the Arena to generate a pattern, then pull the winner into the **Workbench** for granular 1x speed execution tracking.
*   **Label Injection**: Ask models to include `// @logicart` comments in their responses. This makes the Arena flowcharts instantly readable.
*   **Complexity Benchmarking**: Before choosing a "Winner," check the complexity score in the LogicArt sidebar for each model's output.
