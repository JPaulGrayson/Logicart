Refactor task manager to use direct JavaScript for state management
Build a simple "Task Manager" app with these interactive features:

An input field to add new tasks
A button to add the task to a list
Each task shows with a checkbox to mark complete
A delete button to remove tasks
A counter showing total tasks and completed tasks
Focus on the working UI, not code display. This should be a functional mini-app.
Checkpoint made
Add interactive task management features with task tracking

Add this script tag to the HTML <head>:
<script src="https://logic.art/remote.js?mode=push&hideBadge=true"></script>
When clicked, the button must:
Find the main script file this app uses (check the <script src="..."> tag in the HTML)
Fetch the full, raw source code from that file
Pass that exact string to: window.LogicArt.visualize(code, 'AppCode')
The flowchart must show the actual live code of the application - state handling, event handlers, DOM updates - not summaries or placeholders.

Test by clicking the button and verifying LogicArt opens with a complete flowchart.
I've added the LogicArt script and a "Visualize Code" button at the bottom of the page. Click it to see a flowchart of the app's complete source code. Does it work as expected?

Interesting, this is exactly the same problem that Antigravity has been stuck. When you click View Flowchart it brings up a browser page with a blank page. I am starting to think there is a program with the logicart core/embed
problem

Update code visualization to use the correct tool

Nope same problem

Right, as I said Antigravity is having the same problem, please create a summary of this issue so I can give it to Logicart to fix
Here's a summary you can share with LogicArt/LogiGo:

Issue Report: LogiGo Visualize Opens Blank Page

Environment:

Script: https://logic.art/remote.js?mode=push&hideBadge=true
Browser: Safari (based on screenshot)
Multiple Replit projects affected
What's Working:

The remote.js script loads successfully
Console shows: "🔗 LogiGo Studio connected!"
Console shows: "📊 View flowchart at: https://logic.art/?session=..."
Console shows: "[LogiGo] 📦 Push mode enabled. Use LogiGo.visualize(code, name) to send clean code."
Console shows: "[LogiGo] Session created: xxxxxxxx" when visualize() is called
What's NOT Working:

When window.LogiGo.visualize(code, 'AppCode') is called, a new tab opens to about:blank
The flowchart page never renders - just shows a completely blank page
This happens with both complex TypeScript/React code AND simplified plain JavaScript
Code Being Sent:
Simple JavaScript with functions like createTask(), toggleTask(), deleteTask(), fetchTasks(), renderTasks() - standard DOM manipulation and fetch API calls.

Reproduction Steps:

Add <script src="https://logic.art/remote.js?mode=push&hideBadge=true"></script> to HTML
Fetch source code and call window.LogiGo.visualize(code, 'MyCode')
New tab opens but shows blank page instead of flowchart
Expected Behavior:
The flowchart visualization should render in the opened tab.

Affected Projects:

Task Manager app (this project)
Antigravity project (same issue)
This appears to be an issue with the LogiGo service's flowchart rendering, as the connection and session creation are successful but the visualization page fails to display.
