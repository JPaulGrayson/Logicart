Technical Issue Summary for LogicArt Support
Environment
Integration Method: Remote Bridge (https://logic.art/remote.js?mode=push&hideBadge=true)
Platform: Replit (listed as "Bi-directional" on LogicArt landing page)
Code Type: React/TypeScript components (.tsx files)
Browser: Safari on macOS (based on screenshots)
What Works
Session Creation: API endpoint POST /api/remote/session successfully creates sessions with our code
Code Storage: Verified via GET /api/remote/session/{sessionId} that the full React/TypeScript source code is stored correctly
Connection: Console shows [LogiGo] Session created: {sessionId} and [LogiGo] Control channel connected (bidirectional)
Studio Opens: New tab opens to https://logic.art/?session={sessionId}
CODE Panel: The left-side CODE panel in LogicArt Studio correctly displays the React component source code (imports, useState, useEffect, etc.)
Connection Header: Shows correct session name like "Connected: Tour Maker-1768341209142"
What Doesn't Work
Flowchart Visualization: The flowchart diagram always shows the default "CALCULATEAVERAGE" and "FUNCTION CALCULAT..." example instead of parsing and rendering the submitted React/TypeScript code
This happens consistently for all components we've tested
API Calls Made
// Using LogiGo.openWithCode or LogiGo.visualize
fetch("https://logic.art/api/remote/session", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    name: "Component Name-" + Date.now(), 
    code: reactTypescriptSourceCode 
  })
});
Session Data Example
{
  "id": "3981c0ec-02e3-4ec2-bc48-77fd7001d980",
  "name": "React Component Test",
  "code": "import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent...",
  "checkpointCount": 0,
  "viewerCount": 0,
  "createdAt": "2026-01-13T21:57:02.279Z"
}
Comparison
Antigravity (Native integration): User reports flowcharts render correctly
Replit Remote Bridge: Code received but flowcharts don't render
Suspected Issue
The flowchart parser/renderer in the Studio frontend may not be triggering for code received via Remote Bridge sessions, even though the code is successfully stored and displayed in the CODE panel. Possible causes:

Parser not auto-triggered for remote sessions
React/TSX syntax not being recognized for flowchart generation in remote mode
Session state difference between native and remote integrations

Let me know if LogicArt needs access to test this directly on our Replit deployment.
