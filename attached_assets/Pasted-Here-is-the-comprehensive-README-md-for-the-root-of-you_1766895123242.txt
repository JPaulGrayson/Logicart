# LogiGo: Interactive Flowcharts for Your Code



**LogiGo** is a developer tool that brings live, interactive flowchart visualization directly into your React applications. It converts your source code into navigable diagrams *automatically*, allowing you to visualize execution flow, track variables, and "time travel" through your logic.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Live Visualization:** Watch your code execute in real-time on a generated flowchart.
* **Time Travel Debugging:** Step backward and forward through execution history with a timeline slider.
* **Synchronous & Safe:** Zero impact on your function signatures (no `async/await` required). Includes infinite loop protection.
* **Build-Time Analysis:** Uses a Vite plugin to generate flowcharts during build, ensuring zero runtime parsing overhead in production.
* **Hot Reload Support:** Automatically detects code changes and refreshes the visualization without losing your session.

## 📦 Installation

LogiGo consists of a Vite plugin (for analysis) and a React component (for visualization).

```bash
# Install the Embed component and the Vite plugin
npm install logigo-embed logigo-vite-plugin --save-dev

🛠️ Integration Guide
Step 1: Add the Vite Plugin
The plugin analyzes your code during the build process to generate the logigo-manifest.json.
vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import logigo from 'logigo-vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    logigo({
      // Only instrument source files you want to visualize
      include: ['src/**/*.ts', 'src/**/*.tsx'],
      exclude: ['src/main.tsx', '**/*.test.ts'],
      
      // Auto-inject checkpoints (Default: true)
      autoInstrument: true 
    })
  ]
});

Step 2: Add the Embed Component
Place the <LogiGoEmbed /> component at the root of your app. It will automatically fetch the manifest generated by the plugin.
src/App.tsx
import { LogiGoEmbed } from 'logigo-embed';
import 'logigo-embed/dist/style.css'; // Don't forget CSS!

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <YourAppContent />
      
      {/* The floating debug panel */}
      <LogiGoEmbed 
        manifestUrl="/logigo-manifest.json" 
        position="bottom-right"
        theme="dark"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

💡 How It Works
LogiGo uses a Split Architecture to ensure high performance:
 * Build Time (The Brain): The Vite plugin parses your AST, generates stable Node IDs (resistant to whitespace changes), and creates a manifest.json. It injects lightweight LogiGo.checkpoint() calls into your code.
 * Runtime (The Nervous System): The injected checkpoints send data to the LogiGoRuntime. This runtime batches updates into microtasks to prevent blocking the main thread.
 * Visualization (The Face): The LogiGoEmbed component reads the manifest and the runtime messages to render the active flowchart overlay.
Safety Features
 * Infinite Loop Protection: The runtime automatically throttles and drops checkpoints if the queue exceeds 5,000 items, preventing your browser tab from crashing during accidental infinite loops.
 * Lazy Loading: The visualization engine (Dagre) is lazy-loaded only when needed, keeping your initial bundle size small.
📖 Component API
<LogiGoEmbed />
| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| manifestUrl | string | Required | URL to the logigo-manifest.json generated by Vite. |
| position | string | 'bottom-right' | Screen position: 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left', 'top-right', 'top-left'. |
| defaultOpen | boolean | true | Whether the panel starts expanded. |
| showVariables | boolean | true | Show the variable inspector panel. |
| showHistory | boolean | true | Show the execution timeline/history. |
| theme | 'dark' | 'light' | 'dark' | UI theme for the panel. |
| code | string | undefined | Static Mode Only: Pass raw source code string here to visualize it without a manifest (useful for demos). |
⚡ Troubleshooting
"Ghost UI" / Stale Flowchart
If you see the flowchart desync from your code after a Hot Reload (HMR):
 * LogiGo automatically detects hash mismatches and refreshes. If it persists, click the "Refresh" button in the panel header.
"Queue Overflow" Warning in Console
 * This means your code is executing extremely fast (e.g., a tight while(true) loop). LogiGo has temporarily paused tracking to save your browser. It will resume automatically when execution slows down.
