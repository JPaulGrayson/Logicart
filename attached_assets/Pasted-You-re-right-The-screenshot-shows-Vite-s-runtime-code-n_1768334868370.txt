You're right! The screenshot shows Vite's runtime code, not the actual Turai app. This happens because Vite transforms and bundles the code during development.

Let me explore Turai's structure so we can discuss the best approach:

Now I have a good picture. Here's Turai's structure:

The Challenge
LogicArt is designed to visualize code flow (functions, conditionals, loops) - not necessarily component hierarchies. The current approach fetches one bundled file, but Turai has 50+ source files.

Options to Discuss:
Pick specific files to visualize - Add a dropdown/modal where you can select which component/service to flowchart (e.g., "TourPage.tsx" or "tour-maker/CreateTour.tsx")
Generate architecture diagram - Create a separate view that shows the component tree/relationships (but this would be a custom solution, not LogicArt)
Visualize App.tsx routing - Just flowchart the main 
App.tsx
 to show the high-level route structure
DevMode: Visualize current view - Detect which component is currently rendered and flowchart that specific file
