Integration: LogicArt Code Visualization (remote.js)

Executive Summary
LogicArt integration was successfully implemented and tested. Core functionality works well including architecture visualization, component flowcharts, and playback controls. Minor issues identified relate to popup window behavior and UI overlay interactions.

Integration Details
Component	Implementation
Script Source	https://logic.art/remote.js
API Methods Used	openArchitecture(), visualize(), connectControlChannel()
Source Endpoint	/api/source?file={path} (dev-only)
Files Indexed	65 components across client/, server/, shared/
Test Results
TEST 1: Basic Integration ✅ PASSED
Flowchart button renders in sidebar header
Dropdown menu displays correctly with all options
"View Full Architecture" option works
Console logs confirm: [LogiGo] Architecture built: 65 components
TEST 2: Single Component Flowchart ✅ PASSED
Individual component selection works (tested: BubbleSort)
LogicArt popup opens with component code
Session creation logged: [LogiGo] Code registered. New session: {id}
Source code fetched successfully via /api/source endpoint
TEST 3: Bidirectional Control Channel ✅ PASSED
WebSocket connection established on component mount
Console confirms: [LogiGo] Control channel connected (bidirectional)
No WebSocket errors observed
TEST 4: Flowchart Playback ✅ PASSED
Play button found and responsive
Step button found and responsive
Reset button found and responsive
UI updates observed during playback
Remote session logs confirmed
TEST 5: Click-to-Drill-Down ⚠️ PARTIAL
Architecture graph renders with 65 components
Component nodes visible with connection lines
Issue: Click events on nodes intercepted by Debug/Execution panel overlay
Escape key dismisses panel but subsequent clicks still blocked
Likely cause: z-index layering or canvas event handling
Issues Encountered
Issue 1: Development Environment Error Overlay (Not a LogicArt bug)
Symptom: Vite runtime-error-plugin displays "(unknown runtime error)" overlay
Cause: Replit's error detection triggers on popup window creation
Impact: Visual disruption only; dismissible with Escape key
Resolution: N/A - environment-specific false positive

Issue 2: Node Drill-Down Blocked by Debug Panel
Symptom: Cannot click component nodes in architecture view
Cause: Debug/Execution panel intercepts pointer events on canvas
Impact: Prevents drill-down navigation to individual components
Suggested Fix: Adjust z-index layering or add explicit close button for Debug panel

Issue 3: HMR Cache Conflicts (Not a LogicArt bug)
Symptom: Transient "Invalid hook call" React errors during development
Cause: Vite Hot Module Replacement caching stale component code
Impact: Temporary; resolved by page refresh or server restart
Resolution: N/A - standard HMR behavior

Console Logs Observed (All Expected)
[LogiGo] Code registered. New session: a7d09581
[LogiGo] Studio URL: https://logic.art/?session=...
[LogiGo] Control channel connected (bidirectional)
[LogiGo] Architecture view: 65 files from .../api/source
[LogiGo] Architecture built: 65 components
Recommendations for LogicArt Team
Debug Panel Overlay - Consider lowering z-index or adding a visible close/minimize button so users can interact with the architecture canvas underneath
Node Click Targets - Architecture nodes may need larger hit areas or event handlers that aren't blocked by overlaying panels
Popup Error Handling - Some dev environments (like Replit) have aggressive error detection. Wrapping popup initialization in try-catch and ensuring thrown values are proper Error objects may reduce false positives
Documentation - The API methods work as expected. Consider documenting:
Expected console log prefixes for debugging
Popup window dimensions/requirements
Browser compatibility notes for window.open() behavior
Conclusion
The LogicArt integration is production-ready for its core use cases:

✅ Viewing full project architecture
✅ Visualizing individual component flowcharts
✅ Playback controls for stepping through code
✅ Bidirectional debugging via control channel
The drill-down feature needs attention from the LogicArt team regarding the Debug panel overlay blocking clicks.
