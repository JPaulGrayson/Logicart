Summary
I've completed a comprehensive audit of LogiGo's documentation. Here's what I found:

Overall Status: EXCELLENT (9/10) ✅
The existing documentation is accurate, comprehensive, and well-organized. The only gaps are the 6 newly delivered V1 features that haven't been documented yet.

What's Already Documented (Perfect)
✅ All core features (Static Mode, Live Mode, Remote Mode)
✅ User Labels (@logigo: annotations)
✅ Bidirectional Editing
✅ Model Arena (4-AI comparison)
✅ Debug Arena
✅ BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
✅ VS Code Extension
✅ View Levels
✅ Collapsible Containers
✅ Visual Handshake
✅ Ghost Diff
✅ Breakpoints
✅ Variable History
✅ Algorithm Examples
✅ Keyboard Shortcuts (mostly complete)

What's Missing (V1 Features)
❌ Layout Presets (5 quick layouts)
❌ Zoom Presets (25%, 50%, 100%, Fit)
❌ Undo/Redo History (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
⚠️ Enhanced Sharing (needs update for database-backed features)
❌ Arena Example Selector (6 pre-built prompts)
❌ Agent API (programmatic code analysis)

Action Items for V1 Launch
🔴 CRITICAL (6 items, ~55 minutes)
Add Layout Presets documentation to HelpDialog
Add Zoom Presets documentation to HelpDialog
Add Undo/Redo History documentation to HelpDialog
Update Shareable URLs section with new features
Add Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y to keyboard shortcuts
Update About tab feature list
🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (3 items, ~55 minutes)
Add Arena Example Selector documentation
Create AGENT_API.md external documentation
Add "New in V1" section to INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
Total Work: ~110 minutes (less than 2 hours)

Documentation Quality
Strengths:

✅ Comprehensive coverage of all major features
✅ Well-organized with logical tab structure
✅ User-friendly with plain language
✅ Technically accurate (all docs match implementation)
Weaknesses:

❌ Missing V1 feature documentation
⚠️ No screenshots or visual aids
⚠️ Limited troubleshooting section
The full audit is saved at: 

docs/DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md

It includes:

✅ Feature-by-feature documentation status
✅ Specific text recommendations for each missing feature
✅ Exact line numbers where to add documentation
✅ Priority rankings for each action item
✅ Time estimates for completion
My recommendation: Complete the critical items (~55 min) before V1 launch. The documentation will then be production-ready! 📚
