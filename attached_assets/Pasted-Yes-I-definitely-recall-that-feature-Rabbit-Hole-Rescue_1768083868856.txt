Yes, I definitely recall that feature! Rabbit Hole Rescue was the conceptual name we used for the high-end debugging assistance feature, specifically intended for the Pro/Founder tier.

Based on our design discussions and the current codebase, here is the breakdown of what it refers to:

1. The "Consensus" Architecture
Rabbit Hole Rescue was the "Phase 2" of the Council Service. While the standard AI assistance might give you a single answer, the "Rescue" feature uses a Multi-Model Consensus approach:

The Council: Four models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Grok) analyze the problem in parallel.
The Chairman: A final "verdict" model reviews all four outputs, ruthlessly identifies subtle flaws (like race conditions or security risks), and picks the safest/best path forward.
2. Implementation Status
In the current project, you can see the "Rescue" identity in two main places:

Model Arena (The Engine): The actual logic is implemented in the Model Arena page. When you switch to "Debug Advisor" mode and request a "Chairman's Verdict," you are using the core logic of Rabbit Hole Rescue. It moves the cognitive load from you to the AI "Chairman" to decide which model is actually right.
Workbench (The UI): There is a "Rescue" button (with an anchor icon ⚓) in the top toolbar of the Workbench. If you have the rabbit_hole_rescue feature flag enabled in your Voyai license, it is intended to trigger this consensus-driven help. Currently, it serves as a gated entry point that shows a "coming soon" toast or an upgrade modal.
3. The "Trap" Logic
One of the most unique parts of the "Rescue" prompt (found in 
councilService.ts
) is designed to look for "traps"—it specifically instructs the AI to:

"Analyze the user's original request to understand the 'Trap' (e.g., if they asked for money transfer, the trap is a Race Condition)... Ruthlessly compare the 4 solutions."

The goal was to literally pull a developer out of a "rabbit hole" they've fallen into by providing a senior architect's level of synthesis.
