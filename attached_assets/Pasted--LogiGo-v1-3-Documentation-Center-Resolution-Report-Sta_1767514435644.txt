 LogiGo v1.3 Documentation Center Resolution Report

## 📋 Status Update
The Documentation Center has been transitioned from v1.2 to **v1.3**. Key stability issues regarding file routing (404s) and UI regressions (scrolling) have been resolved using direct codebase modifications and terminal-based verification.

## 🛠 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Documentation Routing & 404 Resolution
**Issue:** requested slugs like `getting-started` or `agent-api` were failing to load because of strict string matching and missing whitelist entries in the backend.

**Changes:**
- **Modified File:** `server/routes.ts`
- **Updated Whitelist:** Added `AGENT_API.md` and `ANTIGRAVITY_V1_FEATURE_REVIEW.md` to `ALLOWED_DOCS`.
- **Robust Matching Engine:** Rewrote the lookup logic in `/api/docs/:file` to:
    - Perform case-insensitive matching.
    - Normalize both request slugs and filenames (handling hyphens `-` vs underscores `_` interchangeably).
    - Ensure FS-safe exact-case resolution even if the request casing is mismatched.
- **New Slug Mappings:** Added `agent-api` and `feature-review` to the high-level `DOC_SLUGS` dictionary.

### 2. Scrolling Regression Fix
**Issue:** Navigating between large documentation chapters within the `HelpDialog` would leave the scrollbar at the bottom of the previous document instead of resetting to the top.

**Changes:**
- **Modified File:** `client/src/components/ide/HelpDialog.tsx`
- **Solution:** Injected a `key={activeSection}` prop into the Radix `ScrollArea` component. This leverages React's reconciliation engine to remount the scroll viewport whenever the chapter changes, causing an automatic and clean reset to the top without manual DOM manipulation.

### 3. v1.3 Feature Additions
- Added **Agent API** to the visible sidebar in `HelpDialog.tsx`.
- Updated branding and metadata strings to reflect **Documentation Center v1.3**.

## 📝 Technical Notes for Replit Agent (Handoff)
If you are asking Replit Agent to verify these changes via his browser:
1. **Endpoint to Test:** `/api/docs/getting-started` and `/api/docs/agent-api`.
2. **Behavior to Verify:** 
    - Click "Getting Started", scroll to bottom.
    - Click "Agent API".
    - **Expected:** Content should load instantly and view should be at the TOP.
3. **Verification Script:** You can run `curl http://localhost:5000/api/docs/agent-api` in the terminal to verify raw JSON response.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Finalize the layout of the `TutorialSidebar.tsx` to integrate with these docs.
- Address the Mermaid diagram syntax overhaul for v11 compatibility in the newly whitelisted files.
