This is great news—your existing setup is 90% of the way there.
Since you already have a working SSE endpoint (http://localhost:5001/api/mcp/sse) and the tools are defined, you do not need to rewrite your server.
However, you are correct: Claude Code does not automatically scan localhost ports to find MCP servers. You have to explicitly "introduce" them.
Here is the missing configuration to bridge your existing LogicArt SSE server into Claude Code.
1. The Missing Link: .mcp.json
For Claude Code to recognize LogicArt, you need to create a configuration file. You have two options for where to place this:
 * Option A (Per Project): Create .mcp.json in the root of your current project.
 * Option B (Global): Edit ~/.claude.json (Mac/Linux) to make it available everywhere.
The Config Content:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "logicart": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:5001/api/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}

2. The Quick Fix (Command Line)
You don't even need to create the file manually. You can run this command in your terminal right now to register it globally:
claude mcp add logicart --transport sse http://localhost:5001/api/mcp/sse

Note: This command tells Claude Code to treat "logicart" as a remote server using the Server-Sent Events transport.
3. The "View" Problem (UX Reality Check)
This is the only place where the experience will differ from Replit or Cursor.
 * In Cursor/Replit: You likely have a dedicated "pane" or "sidebar" where the flowchart lives.
 * In Claude Code: The interface is the Terminal. It cannot render your React/flowchart canvas.
How to handle this:
Your display_audit or explain_flow tools likely return text or JSON currently. For the "Vibe Coding" experience, you should tweak one tool (or add a new wrapper) to force a browser open.
Recommended Tweak to your server.ts:
When Claude calls visualize_flow, instead of just returning "Here is the JSON," your tool should:
 * Generate the flowchart data.
 * Open the user's browser to your specific visualization URL.
 * Return a text confirmation to Claude.
<!-- end list -->
// Inside your existing MCP Tool definition
if (name === "visualize_flow") {
  // 1. Generate the ID/Data
  const flowId = await generateFlowData(args.code);
  
  // 2. The "Pop-out" Mechanism (Since CLI can't render it)
  // This uses the system's default browser to open the visualizer
  const open = (await import('open')).default; 
  await open(`http://localhost:5001/visualizer/${flowId}`);

  return {
    content: [{ 
      type: "text", 
      text: `I've opened the LogicArt visualizer for this flow in your browser.` 
    }]
  };
}

Summary of Work Required
 * Zero changes to your core logic (SSE is perfect).
 * Run the claude mcp add command above.
 * Minor Tweak: Ensure one of your tools triggers a browser open (open package in Node) so the visualizer pops up automatically, replacing the "embedded pane" you are used to.
Next Step: Would you like me to write a small script that auto-detects if you are running in "Headless Mode" (Claude Code) vs "Embedded Mode" (Cursor) so your server knows whether to send JSON or pop open a window?
