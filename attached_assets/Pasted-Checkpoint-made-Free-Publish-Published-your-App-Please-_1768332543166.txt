Please rewrite this prompt to take into account the feedback from Antigravity. Especially him not understanding that the ui graphics for the algrorithn were meant to be displayed along with the code. "Build a simple "Algorithm Playground" web app where users can:

See a list of 3-4 classic algorithms (Bubble Sort, Binary Search, Fibonacci, FizzBuzz)
Click on one to view its JavaScript code
Have an embedded LogicArt flowchart visualization next to the code
Here's a clearer prompt:

Build an "Algorithm Playground" web app with this layout:
LEFT SIDE: A sidebar listing 4 algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Binary Search  
- Fibonacci
- FizzBuzz
RIGHT SIDE: A split panel with:
- TOP: The algorithm's JavaScript code displayed in a code block
- BOTTOM: An embedded iframe showing the LogicArt flowchart visualization
When the user clicks an algorithm in the sidebar:
1. Display its code in the top panel
2. Load its flowchart in the bottom panel using this iframe URL:
   https://logic.art/?code={URL_ENCODED_CODE}&embed=true
The embed=true parameter gives a clean fullscreen view with code editor and flowchart side by side.
Make sure both the code display AND the flowchart iframe are visible at the same time - the user should see the text code above and the visual flowchart below.
This makes it explicit that:

There's a sidebar for algorithm selection
Code is displayed as text in one panel
Flowchart is an embedded visual in another panel
Both are visible simultaneously
Worked for 16 seconds
I only want this prompt to build the test app. I want to use the separate prompt we have already added to the documentation to install Logicart. The purpose of this test is to proved that a new user could self install Logicart without writing or editing any code
Got it. Here's just the Step 1 prompt to build the app (no LogicArt):

Build an "Algorithm Playground" web app with this layout:
LEFT SIDE: A sidebar listing 4 algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Binary Search  
- Fibonacci
- FizzBuzz
RIGHT SIDE: A split panel showing:
- TOP: The algorithm's JavaScript code in a syntax-highlighted code block
- BOTTOM: A placeholder area labeled "Flowchart will appear here"
When the user clicks an algorithm in the sidebar, display its code in the top panel.
Store each algorithm's code as a string variable so it can be accessed later.
