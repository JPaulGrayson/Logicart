# LogiGo V1 Testing Instructions for Replit Agent
**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Application URL:** https://cartographer-flow-jpaulgrayson.replit.app/  
**Your Role:** Runtime Feature Verification & UI/UX Testing  
**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes
---
## 🎯 Mission Overview
You are testing the **LogiGo V1** visual code debugger application to verify all features work correctly before production launch. This is a **critical pre-launch verification**.
### What LogiGo Does:
- Converts JavaScript code into interactive flowcharts
- Allows step-by-step execution visualization
- Tracks variables in real-time
- Helps developers understand code flow visually
### Your Testing Responsibilities:
You will test **12 features** across 3 categories:
1. **Core Runtime Features** (R1.4 - R1.5): 2 tests
2. **V1 Workspace Features** (R2.1 - R2.5): 5 tests  
3. **UI/UX Features** (R3.1 - R3.4): 4 tests
