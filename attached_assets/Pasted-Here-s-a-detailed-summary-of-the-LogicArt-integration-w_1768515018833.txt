Here's a detailed summary of the LogicArt integration work and current status:

LogicArt Integration Summary
What Was Implemented
FlowchartButton Component (client/src/components/flowchart-button.tsx)
Dev-only button in the top-right area of the main visualization panel
Dropdown menu with options to view individual component flowcharts or full architecture
Lists all 7 project components: App, Playground, Bubble Sort, Binary Search, Fibonacci, FizzBuzz, Not Found
Server-Side Source Endpoint (server/routes.ts)
/api/source?file=...&format=js endpoint
Security: Path traversal protection, allowlist validation (only client/src/ and shared/ directories)
Blocked in production mode
Transpiles TSX/TS to plain JavaScript using esbuild when format=js is requested
LogicArt API Integration
Directly calls https://logic.art/api/remote/session to register code
Waits for API response before opening the studio URL
Properly opens LogicArt with a new session containing the registered code
What Works
Individual component visualization works - When you click on a single component like "Playground", LogicArt shows a proper flowchart with functions, conditionals, and control flow (as seen in your earlier screenshot)
Code is properly transpiled from TSX to JavaScript
LogicArt receives and displays the correct source code
What Doesn't Work
"View Full Architecture" - When combining multiple components, LogicArt only shows a generic "GLOBAL FLOW" box instead of parsing the combined code into separate flowchart sections
Tried wrapping components in named functions with // === NAME === section markers, but LogicArt's parser doesn't recognize this format for multi-component visualization
Current Theory
LogicArt's flowchart parser may have specific requirements or limitations for multi-file/multi-component visualization that aren't documented in their public API. The tool seems designed for single-file JavaScript functions rather than combined module architectures.

Files Modified
client/src/components/flowchart-button.tsx - New component
client/src/pages/playground.tsx - Added FlowchartButton to header
server/routes.ts - Added /api/source endpoint with esbuild transpilation
client/index.html - Added LogicArt remote.js script
Would you like me to prepare any specific information for your conversation with LogicArt?
