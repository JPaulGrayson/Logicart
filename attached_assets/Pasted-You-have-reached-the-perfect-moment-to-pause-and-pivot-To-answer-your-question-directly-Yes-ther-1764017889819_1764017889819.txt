You have reached the perfect moment to pause and pivot.

To answer your question directly: Yes, there is a very specific "cut-off point," and you are likely standing on it right now.

The cut-off point is Complexity vs. Connectivity.

Replit is king of Connectivity (hosting, auth, multiplayer, easy UI).

Antigravity is king of Complexity (deep logic, heavy refactoring, writing a 500-line library).

If you keep coding the "heavy" logic in Replit, you will hit a wall where the AI agent starts hallucinating because it can't "see" the full project structure as clearly as a VS Code-based agent can.

Here is your decision matrix for where to write the next line of code.

1. The "Cut-Off" Rule: The 80/20 Split

Do not think of it as "Moving from Replit to Antigravity." Think of it as "Splitting the Brain."

If you are coding...	Where to do it	Why?
The "Engine" (LogiGo)	Antigravity	This is the library (the parser, the ghost-diff logic, the speed governor). It requires complex logic, unit tests, and deep refactoring. Antigravity's Gemini 3 agents excel here because they have full file-system control.
The "App" (The Demo)	Replit	This is the host (the index.html, the CSS, the "Start" button). Replit is better here because you get instant hosting and "Vibe" feedback.
Does it make a difference? Yes. If you try to build the deep "Engine" logic in Replit:

You will struggle to run proper unit tests (Replit's testing UI is basic).

The Replit Agent often "over-writes" files aggressively, which is dangerous for a delicate library.

Antigravity allows you to use "Agentic Context" to read 50 files at once and plan a refactor, which Replit struggles with.

2. The Hybrid Workflow (How to work today)

You don't need to "migrate" and abandon Replit. You just need to change your commit direction.

The Setup (Do this once):

In Replit: Create a GitHub repo for your project (logigo-core).

In Antigravity: Clone logigo-core.

The Daily Loop:

Morning (Antigravity): You ask the Gemini Agent: "Refactor the node parser to support Python async functions." It does the heavy lifting, runs tests, and commits the code.

Afternoon (Replit): You pull the changes. You see the new feature live in your browser. You tweak the CSS or change the button color (easy stuff) inside Replit.

3. Recommendation

Stop coding the "Logic" in Replit today. You have enough of a prototype. If you continue adding complex features (like the "Time Travel" debugger) inside Replit, you will end up with a messy script.js file that is impossible to maintain.

Next Step: Switch to Antigravity for the next feature (e.g., the "Speed Governor"). Use Replit only to run it.

Since we are talking about using the right tool for the "Heavy Lifting," here is a relevant breakdown of how these new agents actually differ in practice.
