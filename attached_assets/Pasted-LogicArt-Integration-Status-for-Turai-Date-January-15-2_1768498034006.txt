LogicArt Integration Status for Turai

Date: January 15, 2026
App: Turai (AI-Powered Tour Narration)
Platform: Replit
Dev URL: https://21a57f24-e87d-4d4d-a798-702655ececf3-00-vw7qw0ai74e5.picard.replit.dev

Integration Summary

We have integrated LogicArt into Turai to provide code visualization and flowchart capabilities for our React/TypeScript codebase. The integration uses the embedded script approach with a custom /api/source endpoint.

What We Implemented

LogicArt Script Integration
Added <script src="https://logic.art/logi.js"></script> to client/index.html
Script loads successfully and creates window.LogiGo API
Source Code Endpoint (/api/source)
Returns list of available source files when called without parameters
Returns file content when called with ?file=path/to/file.tsx
Includes CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *)
Disabled in production for security
Supports 64 TypeScript/TSX files from client/src/ and shared/ directories
FlowchartButton Component
Dropdown menu in the navigation bar
"View Full Architecture" option calls openArchitectureWithCode() with all 38 key component files
Individual component options call openFlowchart() for single-file visualization
Current Status

Feature	Status	Notes
LogicArt script loading	✅ Working	window.LogiGo available
/api/source file listing	✅ Working	Returns JSON {files: [...]}
/api/source file content	✅ Working	Returns file content as text
Single file flowcharts	✅ Working	openFlowchart() works correctly
Full architecture view	❌ Blocked	CORS error on LogicArt backend
Issue: Full Architecture View CORS Error

Console Error

Origin https://21a57f24-e87d-4d4d-a798-702655ececf3-00-vw7qw0ai74e5.picard.replit.dev 
is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 413
Fetch API cannot load https://logic.art/api/agent/architecture due to access control checks.
What's Happening

Our code successfully fetches 38 source files from our /api/source endpoint
We call LogiGo.openArchitectureWithCode(fileContents) with the file contents
LogicArt's JavaScript then tries to POST to https://logic.art/api/agent/architecture
That endpoint rejects the request because Replit domains aren't in the CORS whitelist
Request to LogicArt Team

Please add the following origins to your CORS allowed origins for /api/agent/architecture:

*.replit.dev
*.picard.replit.dev
*.spock.replit.dev
*.kirk.replit.dev
Or a wildcard pattern that covers Replit's development URLs:

https://*.replit.dev
API Endpoint Details

GET /api/source (no parameters)

Returns a list of available source files:

{
  "files": [
    "client/src/App.tsx",
    "client/src/main.tsx",
    "client/src/features/narration/HomePageNew.tsx",
    ...
  ]
}
GET /api/source?file=client/src/App.tsx

Returns the raw file content as text/plain.

Code Reference

FlowchartButton.tsx (key snippet)

const handleViewArchitecture = async () => {
  const api = window.LogiGo || window.LogicArt;
  
  // Fetch all file contents
  const fileContents: Record<string, string> = {};
  for (const component of COMPONENT_FILES) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/source?file=' + encodeURIComponent(component.path));
    if (response.ok) {
      fileContents[component.path] = await response.text();
    }
  }
  
  // This works - files are fetched successfully
  console.log('[FlowchartButton] Fetched', Object.keys(fileContents).length, 'files');
  
  // This fails due to CORS on logic.art/api/agent/architecture
  api.openArchitectureWithCode(fileContents);
};
Questions for LogicArt

Can you add Replit domains to your CORS whitelist?
Is there an alternative API or approach that doesn't require server-side processing?
Are there any size limits we should be aware of? (We're sending 38 files, ~200KB total)
