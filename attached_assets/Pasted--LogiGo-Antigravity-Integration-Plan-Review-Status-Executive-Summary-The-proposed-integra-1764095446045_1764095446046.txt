# LogiGo × Antigravity Integration Plan - Review & Status

## Executive Summary
The proposed integration plan is **excellent** and perfectly aligns with the "Factory vs. Showroom" strategy we have been executing. It correctly identifies the "Overlay Library" as the critical bridge between the LogiGo engine and the Antigravity platform.

**Status Update:** We are significantly **ahead of schedule** on the LogiGo Team responsibilities.

---

## ✅ Validated & Completed Items
The plan lists several items as "Phase 1" or "Needs Building" which we have **already completed** in the last session:

1.  **Overlay Library Mode (Mode 2)**
    *   *Plan:* "Lightweight injectable NPM package"
    *   *Status:* **DONE.** We built `logigo-core` (NPM package) containing the overlay, runtime, and differ.

2.  **Checkpoint Runtime**
    *   *Plan:* `LogiGo.checkpoint(id)` execution tracking
    *   *Status:* **DONE.** `src/runtime.js` implements `ExecutionController` with Promise-based checkpoints.

3.  **Visual Handshake**
    *   *Plan:* "DOM element highlighting during execution"
    *   *Status:* **PARTIALLY DONE.** `src/overlay.js` includes `highlightElement()` logic.

4.  **Ghost Diff Engine**
    *   *Plan:* "Premium feature"
    *   *Status:* **DONE.** `src/differ.js` implements the diffing logic and visualization.

5.  **NPM Package Structure**
    *   *Plan:* "Week 1-2: Start NPM package structure"
    *   *Status:* **DONE.** `package.json` and `rollup.config.js` are ready.

## 📝 Comments on Specific Sections

### 1. Architecture (Mode 2)
The plan proposes:
```javascript
import LogiGo from '@logigo/runtime';
LogiGo.init({ mode: 'overlay' });
```
**Our Implementation:**
```javascript
import LogiGoOverlay from 'logigo-core';
new LogiGoOverlay({ position: 'bottom-right' }).init();
```
*Feedback:* This is functionally identical. We can alias our export to match the proposed API if strict adherence is required, but our current API is clean and working.

### 2. Package Structure
The plan suggests splitting into `@logigo/core`, `@logigo/runtime`, `@logigo/overlay-ui`.
*Feedback:* For the MVP, a single package `logigo-core` (which we built) is superior. It reduces friction for installation and version management. We should stick to the single package until the bundle size becomes an issue (currently it's very small).

### 3. Antigravity APIs (The "Ask")
The request for `antigravity.execution.onExecutionStart` and `antigravity.ai.onCodeGeneration` is spot on.
*Feedback:* These are the critical hooks. Without `onCodeGeneration`, the "Auto-show on AI code" feature (Flow 1) is impossible. This should be the **highest priority request** to the Antigravity platform team.

### 4. Premium Features
The plan lists Ghost Diff and Time Travel as premium.
*Feedback:* We included Ghost Diff in the core library because it's the "killer feature" for AI code review. We might want to keep it in the core to drive adoption, or implement a software lock if we strictly want to gate it.

## 🚀 Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Revised)

1.  **LogiGo Team (Us):**
    *   **Publish `logigo-core` to NPM.** (Ready to go)
    *   **Refine Visual Handshake.** Ensure the DOM highlighting is robust for complex UIs.
    *   **Implement "Hierarchical Views" (Phase 3 in plan).** This is the next logical step for the library now that the core is done.

2.  **Antigravity Team (Platform):**
    *   **Review the `onCodeGeneration` hook proposal.** This is the integration point for "Gemini generates code -> LogiGo shows flow".

### Strategic Pivot
Since we have already built the "Phase 1" deliverables (NPM package, Runtime, Overlay), we can **accelerate to Phase 2/3**.

*   **Skip:** "Week 1-2: Start NPM package structure" (Already done).
*   **Start:** "Week 3-4: Demo overlay prototype" (We have `complete_demo.html` ready today).

## Conclusion
The plan is solid. We have effectively "pre-delivered" the first 6 weeks of the LogiGo roadmap. We should accept this plan but note our accelerated status.
